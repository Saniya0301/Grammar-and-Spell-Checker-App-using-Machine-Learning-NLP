# 📝 Grammar and Spell Checker App using Machine Learning & NLP

A web-based application built with **Flask** that automatically detects and corrects spelling mistakes and grammar errors in user-input text or uploaded files.  
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** libraries such as **TextBlob** (and optionally GingerIt) to provide intelligent grammar and spell checking.
